## About
Welcome to our project repository! This folder is a part of Project Blue Green Software to show the basic workflow of AIML and TensorFlow Lite on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board.
Feel free to explore the code, example projects, and resources we've shared. If you have any questions, feedback, or ideas, don't hesitate to reach out. We're excited to be part of this vibrant community of makers and innovators.


## Required Installations
1. For Installation of Arduino IDE, please refer to [this link](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. For Installation of Arduino BLE libraries, please refer to [these step-by-step instructions](https://github.com/ProjectBlueGreen/project_blue_green_software/blob/main/basic_AI_ML_Arduino_Nano_33_BLE_Sense/Sensors%20Testing/Sensor%20Lib%20Testing.md).
3. For Installation of TensorFlow Lite Library, refer to [this Step-by-Step guide](https://github.com/ProjectBlueGreen/project_blue_green_software/blob/main/basic_AI_ML_Arduino_Nano_33_BLE_Sense/TensorFlow%20Lite%20Library%20Installation%20for%20Arduino.md).

## Example Projects
<h3>
    
1. You can create [Gesture recognition](basic_AI_ML_Arduino_Nano_33_BLE_Sense/GestureToEmoji) using AI & ML algorithms along with IMU sensors of the Arduino BLE
